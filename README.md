## What is it?
Here is a simple READme generator that can make building a README file very quick and easy! Ever get stalled in the process of making a professional readme? Wells here's an easy fix for all of you!

## Why did we make this?
We got tired of constantly looking back at previous readme's and comparing them to other High-quality readmes that have been produced by various developers. we wanted to make the approach much simpler for ourselves, and thought, why should we be the only ones who can use this!

## How did we go about building this?
This was a bit of a new process in the attempts to bring this program to life and make it functional. 
We needed Node.js (version 16.18), a dependancy called Inquirer ( 8.2.4 version specifically), along with the filesystem dependancy and we also needed knowledge of how to access the terminal and call inquirer into our program, using node.js. 
The whole program was built in Javascript and uses the user's terminal to execute the program! the majority of the programs early days was spent testing to make sure the questions were actually sorting the user's input correctly and a couple of if...else if statements to make sure the license badges and links were being referenced respectivly to their origin.
